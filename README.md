# Eos Payload Module 

---
## About
Eos is the software platform for Georgia Tech's "Lightning from the Edge of Space" high-altitude ballooning project under the VIP program.  This module defines the payload software.  


## Installation
1. Install python >= 3.10 and add to PATH
2. Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/VIP-LES/EosPayload.git`
3. Initialize virtual env: `python -m venv venv` (PyCharm can also do this for you)
4. Every time you want to enter the venv, run `source ./venv/bin/activate` (Note: If you have PyCharm initialize the venv, then the path might look like `./venv/Scripts/activate`)
5. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt` 

Note: to exit the venv, run `deactivate`
